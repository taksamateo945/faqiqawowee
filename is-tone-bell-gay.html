Sexuality of the Survival of the Thickest Cast Examined!</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Tone Bell has been suspected of being gay for a long time now because he has never shared his love interest and was previously spotted with a man. However, the Survival of the Thickest cast has never addressed his sexuality.</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Michelle Buteau</strong></a> is back on <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> with a fresh new comedy series named <a href=#><strong>Survival of the Thickest</strong></a>, and it’s a show that will have you laughing till you tear up. All eight episodes of the first season are now available to view on the streaming site, so be sure to check it out.</p><p>The show stars Buteau as Mavis Beaumont, a proudly Black, plus-size woman who is freshly alone after a devastating relationship and must rebuild her life as a failing fashion designer. Although starting afresh is difficult, Mavis is relieved to know that she has her best friends, Khalil and Marley, to depend on and help her.</p><p>On the other hand, we’ve found that there have been rumors circulating on the Internet that the Khalil actor, <strong>Tone Bell</strong>, is gay. As a result, many viewers wonder if the rumor is true. Well, here’s everything you need to know about his sexuality.</p><p>Previously, we touched on&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Marouane Zotti</strong></a>.</p><h2>Many People Believe Tone Bell Might Be Gay Because He Never Shares His Love Interest & Was Previously Spotted With a Man!</h2><p><strong>Tone Bell </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@tonebell</a>) has never clarified his sexuality. As a result, we’re unaware if he really is gay. There’s a chance people assume the Survival of the Thickest cast might be gay because he has always kept details of his love life secret from the public.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blurred-reality.com/storage/2023/07/tone-bell-is-not-gay.jpg alt="It's unclear whether Tone Bell is gay or not. blurred-reality.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>It’s unclear whether Tone Bell is gay or not.<br>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>There are rumors circulating the internet that Tone was in a relationship with a man in 2015, and several of his fans claim to have spotted Tone with the man. However, the rumors have yet to be confirmed. Just because he was seen with a man does not mean he is gay.</p><p>On the other hand, Tone Bell previously revealed that he was dating a girl during his interview with The Atlanta Journal in 2019, but kept the details to himself. Tone was also said to be secretly dating<strong> Nina Dobrev</strong>, with whom he co-starred in the show, Fam. They played a couple in the series and were so good at it that everyone assumed there was something going on between them. The show was canceled after one season, and Nina and Tone went on to feature in the film, Dog Days, as a couple.</p><p>With all of the given information, we agree that Tone does not want to share his personal to the public and there’s definitely a chance that he might be gay. However, the above information isn’t strong enough to confirm his sexuality. Thus, we will have to wait to determine whether he is gay or not. Not to worry, we will surely get back to you as soon as we get any updates about Tone’s sexuality.</p><h2>Early Life & Career of Tone Bell!</h2><p>Before taking on a production job in <strong>Joseph Sargent</strong>‘s Warm Springs,<strong> Tone Bell</strong> taught first grade and worked on promotional materials. He subsequently relocated to San Francisco, California, and began working at Swivel Media as a brand manager.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blurred-reality.com/storage/2023/07/tone-bell-early-life.jpg alt="Tone Bell got his breakthrough after winning the 2012 NBC Stand Up For Diversity Talent Search. blurred-reality.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>Tone Bell got his breakthrough after winning the 2012 NBC Stand Up For Diversity Talent Search.<br>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>However, after a year, Bell returned to Atlanta and continued marketing work, this time for a beer firm, which led him to relocate to Dallas, Texas.
