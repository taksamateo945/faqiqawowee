Pacino has earned so many awards and honors for his exceptional act in the entertainment industry. We can say he is one the few with the “Triple Crown of Acting”, a combination of an Emmy Award, a competitive Oscar Award and a Tony Award.</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> April 25, 1940</p><p><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Taurus</p><p style=text-align:justify>He did not have it all going for him in the beginning. When Pacino was 2 years old, his parents divorced. He was raised by his mother and grandparents. Al was fondly called The Actor in high school and we are glad he turned out to become one of the globally recognized actors. He dropped out from school at 17 years of age which made his mother really furious. He, however, did a lot of odd jobs and became homeless to sponsor himself through acting school.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Pacino also explored the streets, as he began to drink and smoke at nine years. He never used hard drugs though.</p><p style=text-align:justify>When he started pursuing a career in acting, he was rejected, thank God he met Charles Laughton, who later became his teacher and mentor. This eventually launched him in the entertainment world.</p><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Pacino is an iconic figure in the world of American movies. One culture his grandfather imbibed in him is hard work.</p><p style=text-align:justify>You would rarely see him active on social media though he has many followers on Facebook.</p><p><strong>SUBSCRIBE!</strong></p>&nbsp;<p></p><p style=text-align:justify>Even though the 77 year old was never married, he has two baby mamas, <strong>Jan Tarrant and Beverly D’Angelo</strong> and 3 children, Julie Marie, Anton James and Olivia Rose. Al Pacino and Beverly D’Angelo dated from 1996 – 2003. She is an actress.</p><p style=text-align:justify><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Al Pacino’s ex-girlfriend and mother of his twins Beverly D`angelo" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/al-pacino-girlfriend-beverly-dangelo.jpg alt="Al Pacino’s ex-girlfriend Beverly D`angelo" width=800 height=486 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><br><h2>Al Pacino children</h2><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Julie Marie</strong> <strong>Pacino</strong> (daughter born to Al Pacino and Jan Tarrant)</p><p style=text-align:justify><img decoding=async title="Al Pacino with daughter Julie Pacino" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/al-pacino-family-children-daughter-julie-pacino.jpg alt="Al Pacino’s children - daughter Julie Pacino" width=800 height=628 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Date of Birth:</strong>&nbsp;October 16, 1989</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Libra</p><p style=text-align:justify>She is the eldest of Pacino’s children.

She says she prefers behind the scenes to standing in front of the camera. Her mother’s twitter bio reads “Proud mother of Julie Pacino. Acting and writing teacher/coach.” Tarrant has every reason to broadcast to the whole world she is a proud mother. We are really proud of the woman the 27-year-old Julie is becoming.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Anton James</strong> <strong>Pacino</strong> (son born to Al Pacino and Beverly D’Angelo)</p><p style=text-align:justify><img decoding=async title="Al Pacino with son Anton" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/al-pacino-family-children-son-anton-pacino.jpg alt="Al Pacino’s children - son Anton Pacino" width=800 height=628 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Date of Birth:</strong>&nbsp;January 25, 2001</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Aquarius</p><p style=text-align:justify>He is one of the fraternal twins and the only son of Pacino.
