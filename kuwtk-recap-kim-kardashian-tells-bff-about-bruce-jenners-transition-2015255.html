<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>KUWTK Recap: Kim Kardashian Tells BFF About Bruce Jenner's Transition</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Brrr, it’s cold in here! The Kardashians hit the slopes following their intimate special discussing <strong>Bruce Jenner’s</strong> transition, and they brought plenty of baggage. This week’s episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians chronicled the family’s vacation in Montana, which gave everyone a chance to process Bruce’s change. Highlights included <strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong> face-planting her way down a mountain, <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> dealing with her emotions, and <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> telling her BFF <strong>Jonathan Cheban</strong> the truth about Bruce.</p><p><strong>Kendall’s Lovely Lady Lumps</strong></p><p>Supermodel <strong>Kendall Jenner</strong> has insecurities just like the rest of us mere mortals! The 19-year-old face of Calvin Klein worried about the size and shape of her breasts, saying “Is this like a Jenner thing? Our boobs are really low? See how my boobs look really low?” Profound questions — but <strong>Kris Jenner’s</strong> even more amazing response? “Look at it like you have more room for diamonds.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=479 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Scott Disick Comes Clean About Rehab</strong></p><p><strong>Scott Disick’s</strong> unreliable (and often alcohol-fueled) behavior has been documented on KUWTK, and he commented on his recent trip to rehab. “It’s definitely no secret that I’ve been struggling over the past couple years with some of my inner demons,” The Lord told cameras. “I decided to go to a center and actually work on these things.”</p><p>The center helped Scott confront his problems head on, which he said “was definitely scary, but extremely helpful.” No better way to move forward than with a luxe ski trip, right?</p><p><strong>Bruce Jenner Worries About Kylie</strong></p><p>Back in Malibu, 65-year-old Bruce worried about how Kylie was dealing with his transition — or, more accurately, not dealing with it. “She’s kinda just shut me out lately,” Bruce told Mind In Motion founder Leigh Weinraub. “We’ve had such a close relationship for so many years. And my kids are everything and I want that to continue. I don’t want that space between us.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Kylie refused to confide in her family: “My sisters keep trying to push me to talk about things, but I don’t really wanna talk to anyone else right now.” Kylie eventually called her dad and said she wants to stay close to him. Awwww, these two!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>Kim Kardashian Calls Khloe a “F––ing Bitch”</strong></p><p>Retract those claws! Kim and Khloe had a screaming match over the fact that their respective BFFs weren’t getting along in Montana, and Khloe majorly lost her cool. “Get your head out of everybody else’s ass and pay attention to your family f––ing trip, get over yourself and all your f––ing little people,” she yelled at her older sister.</p><p>Kim’s response? To peace out and say “you’re such a f––ing bitch.” Okay then!</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Kim’s best booty moments</a></p><p><strong>Kim Tells Jonathan Cheban About Bruce’s Transition</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After weeks of staying hush-hush, Kim told her BFF Jonathan Cheban about Bruce’s transition: “I don’t know what to say besides it’s all true,” she confided. “It’s something that Bruce has always felt since he was really little.”</p><p>Kim voiced concern about how Kylie and Kendal were taking the news, and said she thinks Bruce is moving forward with the transition “really fast.”</p><p>Bruce’s eight-part series documenting his transition premieres July 26 at 9 p.m. on E!. Keeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on E!.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOpKywrJtiv6avwKlkpKGdYriivsOaqqGhkaN6tbHLpapmmpabeqKuzq6rZpqiqrCmecmepaedoqh6tb7Ap6qirJmku25%2Bj2psa21l</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whats-the-cure-for-boils-in-harry-potter.html><span>←</span><span>Whats the cure for boils in Harry Potter?</span></a>
