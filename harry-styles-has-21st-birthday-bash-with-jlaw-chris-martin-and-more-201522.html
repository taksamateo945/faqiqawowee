Partygoer Rita Ora shared a picture of one of the cakes, which was clad with a young Styles on it. “One of his cakes @harrystyles #lastnight #birthdayboy #happybirthday,” Ora shared on Instagram the following day.&nbsp;</p><p>While Styles was busy running around greeting guests, J.Law and Martin were enjoying their time together. “Jen and Chris weren’t overly affectionate but they were definitely spending time together,” a second source tells<strong> Us </strong>of the couple, who sat with Adele for a majority of the night. “Chris was ever the gentleman and would get drinks for Jen whenever she needed a refill and sweetly brought her a slice of cake when they were served,” the insider adds.</p><p>Styles, for his part, was a great date as well. Another source tells<strong> Us</strong> his supermodel fling “brought a bunch of her hot girlfriends” with her to the bash, and she “mostly let Harry have his space.” The insider says that Styles wouldn’t stay away from the gorgeous blonde for too long, however. “He ended the night with her,” the source tells <strong>Us</strong>. “He would run over to her and her friends and they'd get all excited and really wanted to make sure he was having fun.”</p><p>After the crowd celebrated Styles with the birthday cakes, the Brit even managed to include his mum <strong>Anne</strong> in on the celebration. “He FaceTimed his mom during the party,” the source tells <strong>Us</strong>. “He swung his phone around the room so she could see the party.”</p><p>At one point, even <strong>Florence Welch</strong> tried to attend the bash, but was rejected at the door by security.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon-to-be second-time parents <strong>Donald Faison </strong>and<strong> CaCee Cobb</strong> also attended the bash, where they seemed to be “enjoying their parents’ night out.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly Osbourne also had a blast. The Fashion Police co-host shared a photo of a photo booth photo session with Styles, Delevingne, and Jones on Instagram on Sunday with the caption: “Last night was so much fun!!! #HappyBirthday @harrystyles ????.”</p><p>PHOTOS: Hot young hollywood</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following the soiree, Jenner, Delevingne, and Ora headed to new karaoke hotspot Blind Dragon, where they sang and partied until 3 a.m.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ%2BaqqKuerTA2KWcrGWYlsBufpCsq2aamafBqbDAsmSbmaOderi106Fko6SRrHqktNGiqmalkafBqrqMmqWdZZ2kv6Z5kWlobmpi</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./night-witches.html><span>←</span><span>How The Night Witches Tormented The Nazis During World War 2</span></a>
