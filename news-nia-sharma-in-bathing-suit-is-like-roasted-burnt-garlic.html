One of her favorite go-to dishes is a simple quinoa bowl. "One cup cooked provides about 8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>say the experts at Harvard Health</span></a><span>. "Unlike some plant proteins, quinoa is a complete protein, meaning that it contains all nine essential amino acids that our bodies cannot make on their own."</span></p><p><span>Sharma keeps it very simple when it comes to her choice of caffeine—the actress enjoys black coffee to start her day and help keep her energized. She follows this up with a vegetable omelet. "We are probably more embracing of eggs within a heart-healthy dietary pattern than we were 20 years ago, but it's still a source of dietary cholesterol," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Jo Ann Carson, professor of clinical nutrition at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas</span></a><span>. "Eating an egg a day as a part of a healthy diet for healthy individuals is a reasonable thing to do."</span></p><p><span>Sharma's favorite food is daal (lentils), which like many other legumes are shown to have health benefits. "We need to know much more about how lentils affect people to draw any definite conclusions," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Elyse Homan, RD</span></a><span>. "But we are learning more about the beneficial effects of what they contain, from fiber and vitamins to polyphenols. And it's clear that people who eat a Mediterranean diet, which includes legumes such as lentils, can have better health outcomes."</span></p><p><span>Sharma is obsessed with CrossFit workouts, and says she can't do without it. "I have started working out religiously, it's gotten me addicted," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>, adding that she's become "that girl" who can go straight from a shoot to the gym. "It's not even the gym, it's functional training," she says.</span></p><p><span>Sharma says she worked hard to achieve a specific look, and taught herself how to do makeup and take care of her skin. "I used to watch makeup videos on YouTube and learn from them," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I then started doing my own make-up for the events, until stylists and different teams came to me. Then later I started getting makeup staff. Today people message me and say that they want to do my makeup. I can't tell the joy it gives me."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkp6GRYsCprdGmmGahnmKvosDHoqWgZaOqtrV5yKxkpaGbmnqzu8Csq56cXZfCs7rTZp6aqpyesHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marcia-dee-mcgreger-death.html><span>←</span><span>Marcia Dee McGreger Death : What happened to Marcia Dee McGreger?
