I mean, are you sitting there holding the baby like, ‘Oh, that’s beautiful, where’s my gift?'”</p><p>He brought some logic into the equation. “Well, c’mon where’d my ring go?” the Law & Order: SVU star asked. “Put the baby to the side, what did I get? It’s not a prize, you don’t win a prize for having a baby.”</p><p>Austin, 36, meanwhile, called it more of an “appreciation gift,” which prompted her husband to reply: “I think if you appreciate your wife and she’s been through a struggle, you can give her a gift. But I don’t think it should be demanded or expected.”</p><p>However, the new talk show host told his wife he had some sweet ideas in mind to express appreciation. “I’m going to take you out to a good dinner,” he joked. “I’ll take you to In-N-Out or something…. so you know I appreciate and love you.”</p><p>The pregnant star replied, “I mean a step up from In-N-Out.”</p><p>“Taco Bell? …Where you wanna go? Wendy’s?” he continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Ultimately, the couple of 13 years agreed to Five Guys.</p><p>Ice T and Coco confirmed their pregnancy last month after struggling to conceive for a while — a story line that was even documented on their reality series Ice Love Coco.</p><p>The couple also <a href=#>stopped by <strong>Us Weekly’</strong>s headquarters</a> in NYC recently to test their parenting preparation.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I always told myself [that] if I have a little girl, I’m gonna keep her in a cage,” Austin — who revealed that she’s expecting a girl (named Chanel, of course!) — joked to<strong> Us</strong> at the time. “[Ice T’s] probably gonna be the cool one.
