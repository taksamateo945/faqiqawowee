First words from Coach Dixon at today's event. #DixonComesHome</p>TCU Basketball <span class=acct>@TCUBasketball</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>"Dreams do come true! Everything I've gotten in my life is because of #TCU." #DixonComesHome https://t.co/cTaSk7x1It</p>TCU Basketball <span class=acct>@TCUBasketball</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>"This felt right.

There's no doubt in my mind we can win championships."</p>TCU Basketball <span class=acct>@TCUBasketball</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>"I'm excited about the team. This is no rebuilding project.

Everything is in place." #DixonComesHome</p><p>Dixon has spent the last 13 years at Pitt, compiling a 328-123 overall record. The Panthers' ascension began under Ben Howland, who took the school to the Sweet 16 in 2002 and 2003. During Dixon's tenure, they've been a fixture in the Big Dance, making 11 appearances.</p><p>TCU, meanwhile, hasn't reached the NCAA tournament since exiting in the first round in 1997-98.&nbsp;</p><p>While many would consider moving to the Horned Frogs a drop in prestige for the 50-year-old, he has ties to the school. He graduated from TCU and played for the basketball team from 1984 to 1987. Adam Zagoria of SNY.tv also reported TCU is willing to throw a lot of money his way:</p>Adam Zagoria <span class=acct>@AdamZagoria</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pitt coach Jamie Dixon is strongly considering taking the TCU job, source confirms to @SNYtv 'They're offering to double his salary.'</p><p>Dixon's total compensation for 2014 was $3.2 million‚Äî$1.4 million in base pay, with $1.7 million in incentives‚Äîper tax documents obtained by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Werner</a> of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</p><p>Pittsburgh athletic director <span>Scott Barnes&nbsp;</span>confirmed to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitt News' Dan Sostek</a> that&nbsp;Dixon had a buyout and that the school "softened" it to release Dixon to the Horned Frogs.</p><p><span class=s1>"A new era in Pitt basketball begins, earnestly," Barnes told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sostek</a>.</span></p><p>Vice Sports' Kevin Trahan said financial power could help TCU and others bridge the gap between themselves and the college basketball elite:</p>Kevin Trahan <span class=acct>@k_trahan</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Football money should redefine how we think of basketball jobs. TCU has it. And it's why VT &amp;gt; Marquette for Buzz.</p><p>One could argue the Panthers stagnated a bit in Dixon's final few years. They failed to advance past the round of 32 in their past five NCAA tournament appearances. With that said, the Horned Frogs couldn't have found a better hire to potentially take them to national prominence.</p><p>Never in Dixon's 13 years did Pitt finish with a losing record. During the same time frame, TCU posted just three winning seasons.</p><p>While the success of the football program has put pressure on the basketball team to win, the athletic department will also hope Dixon's arrival will get the fanbase on board and fill Ed and Rae Schollmaier Arena, which recently received a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$72 million renovation</a>.</p><p><span>It's likely the Horned Frogs' top seven scorers all will return, so </span>between getting Dixon and the talent coming back to the team, TCU could take big steps forward in 2016-17. Earning an NCAA tournament berth might not be an unrealistic expectation.</p><p>For Pitt, replacing Dixon won't be easy. Chris Dokish of the blog Panther's Prey threw out three names the school should pursue:</p>Chris Dokish <span class=acct>@ChrisDokish</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pitt calls, in order: 1. Sean Miller 2. Archie Miller 3. Chris Mack If that doesn't work out, I have about a dozen lesser names.</p><p>CBSSports.com's Sam Vecenie wondered if Barnes might make use of his experience out West:</p>Sam Vecenie <span class=acct>@Sam_Vecenie</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Where Pitt goes from here is fascinating. So many different directions, plus remember AD is from Pac-12/MWC country.</p><p>The Panthers could be in a difficult position. While they play in one of the country's top conferences‚Äîthe ACC‚Äîthey aren't considered a major college basketball power. ESPN.com's Jeff Borzello also thinks the ACC's strength might work against Pitt:</p>Jeff Borzello <span class=acct>@jeffborzello</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>For what it's worth, I don't think Archie Miller is taking Pitt either. Not sure it's even a top-half job in the ACC.</p><p>The cupboard won't be bare for Dixon's successor despite Pitt's 2016 recruiting class sitting 77th in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">247Sports' composite rankings</a>. Forwards Michael Young, Jamel Artis and Sheldon Jeter, who accounted for 38.2 points and 16.5 rebounds per game, are all juniors. Losing senior guard James Robinson will leave a hole in the backcourt, though.</p><p>In the event the school is unable to lure a big name such as Arizona's Sean Miller or Xavier's Chris Mack, it could end up gambling on a coach who hasn't been tested on the kind of stage Pittsburgh will provide.</p><p>While there's every chance a new coach can reinvigorate the program, a return to the pre-Howland years is equally possible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9qZmqDdnnJmqSinV2Ztrm7zWalmqWVmXq1r9RmmZqrm5rBo63LpWShnZGZeqS7wJyfZpufo8GzrcKtZKKmlqR6pLvMppynrKNiv6atwq2gqKY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./five-favorite-disney-apples.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Five Favorite Disney Apples</span></a>
