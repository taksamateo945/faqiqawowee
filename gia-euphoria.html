<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Who Plays Gia Bennett In Euphoria And How Old Is She?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Gia Bennett, the sister of Rue Bennett, suffers more emotional and traumatic events than most of the other teens in Euphoria do for someone her age. In Euphoria, almost every character’s actor is substantially older than the character’s actual age, which is usual for most TV shows, especially those with such serious content. While the characters’ ages were considerably more apparent in Euphoria season 1 in 2019, the timeline of Euphoria season 2 after its 2022 premiere has obscured the ages of the teens.</p><p>Along with Ashtray, Gia (Storm Reid) plays Rue’s (Zendaya) younger sister and is one of the youngest recurrent characters in Euphoria. However, Gia’s part is less significant because most of her scenes take place at Rue’s house. Gia discovered Rue overdosing at home the summer before Rue’s junior year, and Storm Reid’s character instantly dialled 911, setting the scene for Euphoria. The kindhearted Gia is regarded as one of Euphoria’s most sympathetic characters, particularly in the devastating Euphoria season 2 episode 5 plot. Gia unfortunately lost her father to cancer while coping with her sister’s turbulent drug addiction.</p><p>It’s even more devastating to discover Gia’s age in Euphoria given all of the traumatic and emotionally taxing situations the character has already endured. Gia, who was just 13 years old when she discovered Rue overdose the summer before her junior year in 2018, was only mentioned by Rue in Euphoria season 1 of the show. Since the second season of Euphoria begins in January of the same academic year (2018–2019), Gia appears to be just 13–14 years old. Whereas Gia Bennett’s age on Euphoria has never been confirmed clearly, it has also been suggested that she is an eighth-grader in middle school, while Rue, a character played by Zendaya, and several other characters are juniors in high school.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gia-bennett-euphoria-season-2-episode-5-storm-reid-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>While Gia in Euphoria is only 14 or so years old, Storm Reid’s age difference from her character was widened by the time that passed between seasons 1 and 2. Storm Reid, who played Gia in Euphoria season 2 for the first time when she was just 15 years old, is now 18 and around 4-5 years older than Gia. However, compared to the characters from the high school-aged television series Euphoria, this age difference isn’t that great. While Zendaya is now 25, Rue Bennett should be 17, Nate should be about 18, Jacob Elordi should be 24, Kat should be 17, Barbie Ferreira should be 25, and Lexi should be 17, but Maude Apatow, who is now 24, portrays her in Euphoria. Due to the slow-moving storyline and the fact that the majority of the Euphoria characters are still in their junior or senior years of high school, it might be some time before Gia, who is 14 years old, becomes involved in the drama at her high school.</p><p>Although the series certainly needs Gia as a relatively uninvolved character in order to preserve more sympathetic figures, Gia’s youthful age in Euphoria doesn’t necessarily keep her out of the tragic storylines. Another middle schooler named Ashtray plays a crucial role in Euphoria’s drug-trafficking narratives as the younger adopted brother of Rue’s pal Fezco. Given that Gia and Lexi are the only two individuals involved in the drama who are not also at its heart, it would seem that keeping them as the main moral role models in the middle of all the sorrow is the wisest course of action for Euphoria’s likeable characters. Gia, 14, has experienced some of Euphoria’s most intensely emotional and devastating moments despite not being directly involved in the main conflict.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
