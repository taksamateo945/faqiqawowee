<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Kim Kardashian Wants Adrienne Bailon as Sister-in-Law Despite Feud</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There may still be hope for <strong>Adrienne Bailon</strong> to join the Kardashian family! The singer and actress famously dated <strong><a href=#>Rob Kardashian</a></strong> for years, but got into an ugly feud with Rob's sisters <strong><a href=#>Khloe</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Kourtney</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Kim</a></strong>, last month for her negative comments about her ex and the clan.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Kim lashed out at Bailon, 30, just days ago, when she stopped by Watch What Happens Live with <strong><a href=#>Andy Cohen</a></strong> on Tuesday, Aug. 12, she spoke fondly of the former Cheetah Girl.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim, 33, participated in Cohen's "Plead the Fifth" game, where guests are asked three tough questions and only allowed to skip one. Cohen, 46, opened the segment, asking of Rob's exes, "Who would you rather have as a sister-in-law: <strong><a href=#>Rita Ora</a></strong> or Adrienne Bailon?"&nbsp;</p><p>Taking a moment to ponder, Kim responded, "I would say Adrienne Bailon cause she was in our lives for a long time and I know she's a really sweet girl and she has good intentions and she has a good heart."</p><p>Kim's words stood in stark contrast to her earlier snipes at Bailon, who angered the family <a href=#>when she said in a recent magazine interview</a>, "To be stuck with that Kardashian label, that was so hurtful to me and to my career… [Rob] strategically planned things out so that he could cheat on me, and that to me was so disloyal."</p><p>At the time, <a href=#>Kim tweeted</a>, "Funny how she says being with a Kardashian hurt her career yet the only reason she has this article is bc she is talking about a Kardashian… So sad when people try to kick my brother when he is down #FamilyForever." Khloe chimed in, "thought her and I were cool SMH," while Kourtney added simply, "STILL talking about us?!"&nbsp;<a href=#>Read Adrienne's defense here</a>.</p><p>When she wasn't smoothing things over with Bailon, Kim also spoke to Cohen about her husband <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>, their daughter <strong>North West,</strong> her thoughts on the <strong><a href=#>Beyonce</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Jay Z</a></strong> rumors and her plans for baby number two on WWHL.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>On West's infamous (and to some intolerable) rants:</strong> "Nothing that he says would embarrass me," Kim explained. "There's sometimes where he would talk about something that I might not understand the point that he's really trying to get across and I really understand it after the fact. I totally believe in him and what he's saying. It's really cool to see that he just speaks the truth. I respect his rants. I like what he says."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>On plans for a younger sibling for North:</strong> "I would love baby number two!" Kim gushed. "We're trying. We're having fun trying!"&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>On the worst guest at her glamorous Italian wedding to Kanye:</strong> "As much as I want to say, and I have such a good one, I don't want to out her…" Kim said. "There was one guy and one girl who were completely wasted — actually there was a couple… He wasn't that drunk but one of our hair guys split his pants dancing to Beyonce's 'Single Ladies' and had to run out and he was so embarrassed."</p><p><strong>On Khloe's pre-wedding wildness:</strong> "The problem was at Versailles, everyone got so drunk," Kim spilled. "Khloe got so wasted that she had to do her makeup for my wedding sleeping. We have it all on camera."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>On Beyonce and Jay Z's marital woes:</strong> "You always hope nothing like that's true," she said. "You just wish them the best… We've never double dated unless it's on the road like maybe Watch the Throne tour."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYsSiutOsZJqcop6yr7rEZpmaoZyku26t0maqoqukmr9utc1mo5qvXZmytLzIrZxmnpWqsW5%2Bj2pramto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./crystal-hefner.html><span>←</span><span>Crystal Hefner- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband</span></a>
