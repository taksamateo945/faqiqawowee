In 2016, he caught 52 passes for 453 yards and two touchdowns, adding a kick-return touchdown as well. While he has flashed explosive, game-breaking ability at times, he hasn't consistently produced throughout his career.</p><p>For Patterson, leaving Minnesota was likely indicative of one factor: a lack of playing time.</p><p>"Two years I spent damn near on the sideline," Patterson said in late January, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Conor Orr</a> of NFL.com. "That's never a good feeling for any player. No player wants to go through that. I need to know if I'm going to play or not. If not, I'll take my talents elsewhere."</p><p>Certainly, signing Patterson means Oakland will be expected to utilize him and get the most of his unique skill set. The wideout is dangerous enough with the ball that the Raiders would be wise to give him a large collection of short catches, screens and even carries.</p><p>And he remains one of the best returners in football as well.</p><p>The Vikings never quite cracked the code with Patterson, though Pat Shurmur utilized him more heavily late in the 2016 season after he took over as offensive coordinator. The Raiders would be wise to do the same.</p><p>Certainly, the addition of Patterson gives Oakland an explosive trio at wideout, as he'll pair with <a href=#>Michael Crabtree</a> and Amari Cooper. Much like Crabtree has taken his game to another level since joining the Raiders, Patterson will have the chance to finally live up to the hype that made him a first-round pick in 2013.</p><p>In Oakland, he'll have the chance to play with Derek Carr, the best quarterback he'll have worked with in the NFL. Don't be surprised if Patterson takes a step forward in 2017 and makes a major impact for the Raiders, both on special teams and in the passing game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9xYW6EcnnCqKmdmaKnsq24xGanmqykmr%2B0u81mppqjnJa7pXnRmqCdnaKoeqKz0Z6cZqyfYrCwutOrmJys</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./152512-video-massive-snake-water-people-vowing-swim-river-again.html><span>←</span><span>Snake in Water Goes TikTok Viral With 4.9M Views, Video of Anaconda Has Peeps Vowing to Never Swim A</span></a>
