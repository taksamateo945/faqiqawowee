<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves' Three-Day Wedding Extravaganza: All the Details!</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Before his whirlwind, three-day wedding extravaganza, cold feet weren't an issue for <strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong>.</p><p>At the laid-back Friday night rehearsal dinner — held, like the rest of the weekend's events, at McConaughey's Austin, Texas home — a pal joked to the Lincoln Lawyer star that he "still had time to run."</p><p>McConaughey, 42, wouldn't hear of it. "He [said] he was dedicated to marrying Camila," a wedding guest tells <a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a>. "He definitely wanted this to happen."</p><p>Indeed, when it came to making it official, the couple very recently changed their tunes about marriage. Initially, Alves and McConaughey — who met at a Los Angeles bar in 2006, and have two children together, son <strong>Levi</strong>, 3, and daughter <strong>Vida</strong>, 2 — saw no need to rush down the aisle because they already felt married, as Alves explained earlier this year.</p><p>"We've been living a married life for over six years now," the Brazilian-born beauty, 30, told ET Canada in March. "We have homes together, we have family together, we have kids, we've built a life together. So we've been living a married life this whole time."</p><p>Once the pair decided to go for it, their road to matrimony was a quick one. (McConaughey proposed this past Christmas Day, and as late as this spring, Alves confessed to <strong>Us</strong> she still hadn't begun the planning process.)</p><p>For their big day, McConaughey and Alves decided to stick close to home, setting up a makeshift, high-end campground for wedding guests to stay the weekend on their Texas property — complete with air conditioned tents, gourmet goodies, and plenty of entertainment.</p><p>A-list attendees included <strong>Woody Harrelson</strong>, <strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong>, <strong>Jim Toth</strong>, <strong>John Cougar Mellencamp</strong> and <strong>Meg Ryan</strong>. During the emotionally-charged ceremony, Mellencamp sang a song for the bride and groom based on a bible verse. "He made it into a melody," a witness says.</p><p>After sharing a long, passionate kiss with his new bride, McConaughey thanked everyone for coming — officially kicking off the post-wedding celebration. Guests moved into a massive party tent for the reception, where they noshed on rotisserie-style Brazilian meats and danced to a live band playing American pop and Brazilian rock hits. McConaughey and Alves skipped the wedding cake — instead offering their partygoers a variety of desserts — as well as the traditional first dance.</p><p>But the Shear Genius host and her new husband still boogied the night away. When they were dancing, "You could definitely tell [Matthew] was in love," an eyewitness says, adding that "It was a great night for everyone."</p><p>So great, in fact, that some of the attendees kept the party going all night — and well into the next day. By Sunday afternoon, "some haven't even gone to bed yet!" one insider tells <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>The rest of the day Sunday, guests not too tuckered out from the revelry were treated to food prepared by celeb chef <strong>Guy Fieri</strong>. On the menu? "Crawfish, brisket and fried okra," a source raves of the hearty Southern menu.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>PHOTOS: The best wedding dresses ever!</p><p>One of the weekend's most meaningful moments occurred during the couple's sweet vow exchange. Instead of reading pre-written vows aloud to one another, McConaughey and Alves whispered them into each other's ears.</p><p>"No one knows what they said, but you could tell it was emotional because she was teary-eyed," a pal tells <strong>Us</strong>. "Matthew loves her, there's no doubt about that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSarKSdsrh5zJyaqKaRqrSpsdhmmKecXZiurrXLmmSapKaawG7Ax6ucnmWUlsZuw8Sdm6Kml2KyucDRmq2an5Gjx6J5wKWjZqyYmnqlsdOaoKWrXWd9cn6Qam0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-osceola.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Osceola- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</span></a>
