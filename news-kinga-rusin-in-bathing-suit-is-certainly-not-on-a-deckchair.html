She's currently on a trip to Brisbane, and posted highlights on Instagram. In one photo, she enjoyed time in a hotel pool. She wore a black one piece swimsuit, looking stunning. Rusin captioned it, "</span><span>And how do you keep fit after those fantastic dinners in Brisbane, the culinary, and beyond, the Queensland capital? Definitely not on a deck chair. It's good that leaving our room was straight to the pool so I had no excuses."</span><span> How does she stay so fit? Read on to see 5 ways Kinga Rusin stays in shape and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>Rusin likes to practice yoga as a way of staying in shape. She shared </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>this photo</span></a><span> of herself in a tree pose on the beach in Costa Rica. "Yesterday. Insane beach and magical sunset – I couldn't resist… The best thing about practicing yoga is that you can do it anywhere, at any time, without special equipment, without fancy clothes. All you need is an impulse. There is no competition in yoga, you can only be a better version of yourself every day. Yoga is not gymnastics, it's a conversation with your own body and soul, from which you can learn a lot about yourself. However, fortunately for me, there are no shortage of challenges here. In order to stand on one leg (on barefoot, on an uneven rock, with the wind from the sea) and raise your hands up, you need focus and a balanced, deep breath. If you can still close your eyes and stay in this position for a few minutes, magical experiences are guaranteed. Would recommend!"</span></p><p><span>Rusin likes to ride horses. She shared </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>these highlights</span></a><span> of herself riding in different places on Instagram. She captioned it, "</span><span>Not the first time I ride like this. Whenever it is possible, I choose this particular style and the places that promote it. A few archival photos in the gallery to prove it. This is how I rode a horse through the Dragons Mountains in South Africa, traversed the golden beaches of Sumba, rode the Argentinian pampas and a few hundred meters wide Atlantic coast (there was a light trough here, but no substitute), and recently galloping with giraffes in Kalahari Desert. An unforgettable experience every time.</span><span>"</span></p><p><span>Rusin spends a lot of time at the beach. One thing she likes to do is go surfing. She shared</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> this photo</span></a><span> on Instagram of herself with her board in Costa Rica. She captioned it, "And… It was love at first sight. Surfing (not to be confused with kitesurfing) is our next, common sports passion."</span></p><p>Rusin also likes to kitesurf. She shared these photos on Instagram. Rusin captioned the post, "May in Rhodes is paradise! Peace, quiet, everything blooms and smells, it's green, birds are singing and deer are approaching our house. The season is just getting started – the whole beach on the 'windy' side where kitesurfing is basically empty! After work the madness begins&nbsp; – we lay out the kites and jump on the boards with Mark to race the waves. Yesterday it blew 26 knots! Wind and water, powerful forces of nature, taming gives power and adrenaline."</p><p><span>Rusin spends a lot of time outside. She likes to go hiking as a way of staying in shape. Rusin shares a lot of hiking photos and videos on Instagram. She posted </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>this video</span></a><span> of herself in the forest, captioning it, "Be like Jane Goodall! Just for a little while." Rusin also posted </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>these photos</span></a><span> of herself hiking in the Daintree Rainforest. She captioned it, "</span><span>Had a great, albeit exhausting day at Daintree National Park, hours trekking through the amazing ancient jungle, boat trip on the river full of giant rosary crocodiles, walk on the beautiful Myall beach, great times at Cape Tribulation, the only place in the world where as many as two wonders of nature meet on the World Heritage List."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpKGenK5uvtSsoKdlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKKqZpuVp8Gitc2lsGamn6l6sLqMmmSdnZOgsKmtyKtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mom-confesses-that-her-abused-child-8-died-while-she-was-having-sex-at-a-hotel.html><span>←</span><span>Mom confesses that her abused child, 8, died while she was having sex at a hotel</span></a>
