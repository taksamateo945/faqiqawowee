Cook is set to join a crowded running back depth chart that includes the recently signed Latavius Murray, 2014 third-round pick Jerick McKinnon, 2014 <a href=#>Tennessee Titans</a> second-round selection Bishop Sankey and Augustana (Division II) product C.J. Ham.</p><p>Cook, a three-year starter for the Seminoles, was widely considered a first-round talent, but according to NFL.com's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Patra</a>, off-field concerns stemming from a series of issues during his tenure at Florida State saw him fall completely out of the first round to the midway point of the second round when Spielman put an end to his slide. His off-field affairs do not extend to the field, however, as Cook has been regarded as an excellent teammate and positive presence in the locker room.</p><p>Over the course of three years and 38 games at Florida State, Cook produced 4,464 rushing yards, 46 rushing touchdowns, 79 receptions, 935 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns for a combined total of 5,399 yards from scrimmage and 48 scores. Cook received shoulder surgery ahead of his final campaign with the Seminoles, and while he still was able to participate in 13 games, the ongoing ailment followed him throughout the draft process.</p><p>His testing results at the 2017 NFL combine were impressive despite his shoulder still giving him trouble, as Cook turned in a 4.49-second 40-yard dash, 22 bench press reps, a 30.5-inch vertical leap, a 116-inch broad jump, a 7.27-second three-cone time and a 4.53-second 20-yard shuttle.</p><p>The Vikings, as previously noted, recently added 2016 <a href=#>Oakland Raiders</a> running back Latavius Murray during free agency, but the team remained adamant about acquiring a rookie rusher to upgrade a ground attack that finished dead last in the NFL in rushing efficiency (3.2 yards per attempt) this past season. Minnesota certainly did not hide its interest, as its scouting department either interviewed or scheduled a private workout with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">12 different running back prospects</a> over the past month—none which were Cook.</p><p>Minnesota's selection of Cook will inherently throw the soon-to-be rookie into the extremely difficult and comparison-heavy role of following a Vikings legend and future Hall-of-Famer. While he'll need to improve in pass protection to perfect his three-down skill set, Cook's elite rushing talent, polished receiving skills and game-breaking "second gear" has him primed for a high-impact rookie season—expectations that were also charged to and ultimately fulfilled by Peterson one decade ago.</p><p>"Growing up watching Adrian Peterson," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cook</a> said, "[he is] one of the great running backs I've ever watched, it was something special. To go to the team that he played for is still unreal ... I'm just going to come in, work hard to be the best Dalvin I can be."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXBoZmWDcXnVoqKippeoeqW%2BwJ%2BrZqiZmLi0eZFpaHBloprAtrjTrGSgqpGZsrR5wKebZpmelrm6v8isZJ%2BnomKyoq%2FHZqqepJWYwaq7zQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./al-pacino-children.html><span>←</span><span>The Legendary Al Pacinos Children: 2 daughters and son</span></a>
