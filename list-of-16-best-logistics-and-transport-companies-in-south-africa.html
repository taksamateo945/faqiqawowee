Most of the stock of this company is owned by South Africa’s Department of Public Enterprises. They specialize on:</p><ul><li>Pipeline management</li><li>Port Transport</li><li>Rail transport</li><li>Port management</li></ul><p>Through Transnet Pipeline, they are able to transport petroleum and gas products over a long distance. And through Transnet Freight, its biggest subsidiary, they are able to transport heavy-duty items to different locations.</p><p>Unlike some other logistics companies that may have to contract a different engineering firm for the maintenance and repair of their freight wagons and locomotives, Transnet has a subsidiary called Transnet Engineering that is dedicated to the repair, maintenance, and upgrade, and manufacture of their equipment. In the same vein, the engineering part of the company would also render the same services to anyone who needs them.</p><p>Aside from making profits from the many ventures the company is into, Transnet is also dedicated to building a better South Africa. In a bid to promote the South African government’s black empowerment, Transnet entered a $1.5 billion deal with nine black-owned companies to supply it with fuel for a period of five years. Despite all the growth this company has enjoyed, it had also had its setbacks. In July 2021, it was hit with a cyber-attack. It has also been plagued with executives who have embezzled the company’s funds at one point or the other. In spite of all these, the company has continued to thrive.</p><h3><strong>7.
