 Logan’s eldest son from his first marriage, Connor is the half-brother of Kendall, Shiv and Roman.
Correspondingly, Does Connor have a different mom Succession? Connor is already out of the loop because he has a different mother than Shiv, Roman and Kendall, which creates even more distance from Logan.
Next, Who is Connor Roy’s mother?

Shiv informs Tom she’s not sure if she wants a monogamous relationship. She also confesses her affair with Nate. Before consummating their marriage, Tom asks if he can kick Nate out and Shiv agrees.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Roman_Roy_asexual></span><strong>Is Roman Roy asexual?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many viewers have questioned whether or not Roman is actually asexual—someone who doesn’t experience sexual attraction and/or doesn’t desire sexual contact—but the character nor the actor playing him has officially defined his sexuality.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Logan_Roy_sleeping_with_his_assistant></span><strong>Is Logan Roy sleeping with his assistant?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before Logan makes his pick, we see him and the members of his traveling party — including his assistant, Kerry, who is sleeping with Logan(*), as Roman rightly deduces, and is therefore emboldened to speak out in meetings like a member of the inner circle — being wooed and pursued by those in attendance.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Logan_sleep_with_Rhea></span><strong>Does Logan sleep with Rhea?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marcia takes this opportunity to corner Rhea and confronts her about her affair with Logan. She denies it, Marcia insists on her being safe and wanting to know if she has any STDs because she and Logan still sleep together.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Logan_Roy_a_narcissist></span><strong>Is Logan Roy a narcissist?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>And he wins again and again. As his ex-wife Caroline (Harriet Walter) says, “He never saw anything he loved that he didn’t want to kick, just to see if it would still come back.” Logan is also a classic example of a malignant narcissist, according to Paul L.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Shiv_Roy_The_youngest></span><strong>Is Shiv Roy The youngest?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The youngest child in the Roy family, Shiv possesses natural leadership instincts, but would rather wield her talents in politics.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_is_Roman_Roy_supposed_to_be></span><strong>How old is Roman Roy supposed to be?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Roman Roy</th></tr><tr><td>Real Name:</td><td>Roman Roy</td></tr><tr><td>Title:</td><td>COO of Waystar Royco Board Member of Waystar Royco</td></tr><tr><td>Born:</td><td>1987</td></tr><tr><td>Age:</td><td>34</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_did_Shiv_cheat></span><strong>Who did Shiv cheat?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>This came to the forefront when Shiv cheated on her goofy fiancé with former lover Nate Sofrelli (Ashley Zukerman). “I’ve had a little number,” she told Tom on their Season 1 wedding night. She proceeded to introduce the concept of an open marriage.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Roman_and_Gerri_get_together></span><strong>Do Roman and Gerri get together?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gerri, who’s known to be upfront and career-driven, does not have a love interest in the show, though it seems her and Roman could get together at some point. When asked about their relationship in an Oct. 14 interview with W magazine, Smith-Cameron said it’s highly unlikely that Roman and Gerri will ever be an item.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Roman_and_Gerri_sleep_together></span><strong>Do Roman and Gerri sleep together?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When we first meet this stupendous non-couple, they are not actually sleeping together or involved in any romantic capacity, but the sexual tension between Kieran Culkin as Roman, the youngest in the Roy bunch, and J.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_are_the_scratches_on_Logan_Roy%E2%80%99s_back></span><strong>What are the scratches on Logan Roy’s back?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Graeme Hunter/HBO</p><p>We know that he and his brother, Ewan, grew up in the care of their uncle, Noah. Logan still blames himself for the death of their sister, Rose—and whatever happened to him and Ewan afterward, it seared a lot of angry, red scars into his back.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Logan_sleeping_with_Kerry></span><strong>Is Logan sleeping with Kerry?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Let’s also acknowledge how funny and casually misogynist it is that Logan lectures Roman about how a sexual relationship between him and Gerri is “disgusting” and she’s “a million years old” and this will make Roman “a laughingstock,” considering that it’s certainly been implied (though not confirmed) that Logan is</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Gerri_and_Roman_sleep_together></span><strong>Do Gerri and Roman sleep together?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When we first meet this stupendous non-couple, they are not actually sleeping together or involved in any romantic capacity, but the sexual tension between Kieran Culkin as Roman, the youngest in the Roy bunch, and J.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Roman_in_love_with_Gerri></span><strong>Is Roman in love with Gerri?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It seems like Roman’s very attached to Gerri, and the way it feels to me, Gerri is very attached to Roman in a way too. In spite of herself, he kind of got under her skin.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Peter_Munion_Kendall%E2%80%99s_father></span><strong>Is Peter Munion Kendall’s father?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pip Torrens plays Peter Munion</p><p>The new husband of Lady Caroline Collingwood and step-father to Kendall, Roman and Shiv Roy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Kendall_and_Rava_get_back_together></span><strong>Do Kendall and Rava get back together?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amid dealing with Waystar Royco, Kendall tried to get back with Rava. They hook up, but ultimately, she declines.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Mencken_in_Succession></span><strong>Who is Mencken in Succession?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin Kirk guest stars in the episode as Congressman Jeryd Mencken, a far-right online provocateur with fascist and white supremacist leanings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happened_between_Logan_and_Marcia></span><strong>What happened between Logan and Marcia?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When we last saw her toward the end of Season 2, Marcia had seemingly ended her marriage with Logan because she found out not that he may or may not have been having an affair with Rhea Jarrell, but that he coordinated a plan to pass off the CEO reins to Rhea without Marcia’s knowledge.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Marcia_love_Logan></span><strong>Does Marcia love Logan?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She’s in love with Logan, even though he is not an easy man and not a simple human being. She’s part of it now because they’re married. We learn she doesn’t get overwhelmed — she has control over what happens and enjoys being the serene, decision maker.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Marcia_leave_Logan_in_Succession></span>Did Marcia leave Logan in Succession?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Marcia wasn’t seen leaving the plane with Logan, as he reunited for his obedient children for the waiting press, but we can only assume she’s back in the family fold, her position stronger than ever.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_does_boar_on_the_floor_mean></span><strong>What does boar on the floor mean?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The most recent episode of HBO’s Succession, “Hunting,” will be most remembered for one phrase: “boar on the floor.” That’s the catchy name of the “game” that the Waystar Royco mogul Logan Roy (played by Brian Cox) inflicts on his potentially traitorous underlings, forcing some of them to oink like piggies and scuffle</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Logan_Roy_an_abusive_father></span><strong>Is Logan Roy an abusive father?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Logan Roy ended Season 3 with a devastating blow against his children—the latest in a brutal pattern of abuse that prompted a childlike plea from his youngest, most toxic son.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_wrong_with_Kendall%E2%80%99s_son_on_Succession></span><strong>What is wrong with Kendall’s son on Succession?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Iverson Roy is the son of Kendall and Rava Roy, and the younger brother of Sophie Roy.
