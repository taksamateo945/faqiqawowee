Many just looked at it like he was just getting a replacement. Thing is, if he proposed to her, hopefully that will shut the mouths of some of the naysayers. Their courtship was long enough, she has given him a child, and now he wants to make a wife out of her. Seems like love to me.</p><p>Best of luck to Reggie Bush and his wife. From what he have seen of statistics with marriages, they have about a six month window before reality sets in.&nbsp; That and the whole “over 50% of marriages end in divorce.” But hey, we’re going to remain optimistic about all of this.&nbsp; Best of luck in Detroit Reggie.&nbsp; P.S. please let Kimye be at this wedding.&nbsp; Please!</p><p>(Photo by Joe Scarnici/Getty Images for GREY GOOSE)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGipnp%2BXnrJurtSsn2aflanBqrrGZqSaqqKesqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nottrebeca.html><span>←</span><span>Bio, Career, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
