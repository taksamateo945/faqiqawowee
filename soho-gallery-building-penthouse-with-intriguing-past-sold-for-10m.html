Broadway, otherwise known as the Soho Gallery Building.</p><p>But the striking triplex, with four private terraces, has an intriguingly tangled history.</p><p>It was formerly owned by billionaire hedge funder Bill Ackman and his first wife, Karen — they had bought it for $17 million in May, 2015. (Bill then sold his half to Karen for $7 million in 2018; she then listed it for $15.5 million.)</p><p>Here’s the intrigue. Remember the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">price-gouging at Valeant Pharmaceuticals</a>, which led to a $4 billion loss for Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management?</p><p>Well, Ackman <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bought the penthouse from ad mogul Drew Katz</a>, who earlier that year had warned him about Valeant’s price-gouging issues. The penthouse had been languishing on that market.&nbsp;</p><p>The Soho Gallery Building is also where art dealer Leo Castelli once had his famed gallery.&nbsp;</p><p>The new deal comes after the Hovnanians sold their Greenwich Village townhouse for $15.9 million and moved to Miami.</p><p>They had bought the townhouse for $15.4 million in 2010, and first put it on the market for $21 million in 2011, according to Streeteasy<strong>.</strong></p><p>“Though we’ve been residents of Miami since 2019, and I have my studio there, it is a spiritual experience for me to have a place in the original Castelli building around the corner from where I first showed my work with David Beitzel in 2001,” Lee Hovnanian tells Gimme.&nbsp;</p><p>The two-bedroom, 2½-bathroom, 3,593 square feet loft — designed by architect <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Edward Siegel</a> and designer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ernest de la Torre</a> — was featured in Architectural Digest.</p><p>Details include a walnut-paneled foyer, white oak floors, walnut-covered columns, and 11-foot-two-inch ceilings.</p><p>There’s also a chef’s kitchen, and a great room with a woodburning fireplace wall and a wet bar, along with French doors that open to one of the terraces.</p><p>A stone staircase anchors the room and leads to the private areas — like a main bedroom floor with a large, windowed walk-in closet, a sitting area with a projector screen and surround sound, and a 430-square-foot hot tub on the terrace, along with two private outdoor showers.</p><p>In addition, there’s a 1,145-square-foot private garden with hedges for privacy — and a 637-square-foot upper roof terrace, with a woodburning fireplace, stainless steel wet bar and panoramic views of the city.</p><p>The home is smart-wired for climate control, lighting and electronic shades.</p><p>There’s also extra storage and, natch, a custom built 1,070-bottle, temperature-controlled wine cellar with additional crate storage, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the listing</a> from Douglas Elliman’s Merrily Connery.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxno6S1sHnGmqOlnaKueqPByKWboqaXYr2mutOhpq6rlWLEqsDHZqCnrKKetLa1zaBkqZmjqXq0u8udZJ%2BnomJ%2BcbmO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10046711-roman-reigns-explains-part-time-contract-wwe-rumors-on-solo-sikoa-and-bronson-reed.html><span>←</span><span>Roman Reigns Explains Part-Time Contract; WWE Rumors on Solo Sikoa and Bronson Reed | News, Scores,</span></a>
