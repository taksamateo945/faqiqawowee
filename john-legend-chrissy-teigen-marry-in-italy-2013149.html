<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>John Legend, Chrissy Teigen Marry in Italy -- See Her Wedding Dress!</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>John Legend</strong> and <strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong> are finally hitched! The Grammy-winning singer married the model in an intimate wedding at Villa Pizzo in Lake Como, Italy on Saturday, Sept. 14, his rep confirms to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>. A source tells <strong>Us</strong> the two decided on the specific location because "they first fell in love" there.</p><p><a href=#>Mr. and Mrs. Legend</a> were feted by family and friends, including <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a><strong> </strong>and<strong> Stevie Wonder. </strong>The "Isn't She Lovely" singer also performed for guests as a special treat.<strong> </strong>Actress and model <strong>Brooklyn Decker</strong> was a bridesmaid and Biz Markie helped DJ the celebration. Teigen's other close friend and bridesmaid, sports journalist <strong>Erin Andrews</strong>, was unfortunately unable to take off work to attend.&nbsp;</p><p>Teigen, 27, wore three <a href=#><strong>Vera Wang</strong></a> dresses for the big occasion, including an ivory strapless open back, V-neck ballgown for the ceremony, and an ivory strapless mermaid gown with a pleated bodice for the reception. She finished off her stunning looks with a crimson strapless mermaid gown with a hand-draped bodice and inverted flange skirt with crystal embroidery for the after party. She walked down the aisle through a path of roses and carried a bouquet of white and pink flowers.</p><p>To top it off, the blushing bride even got serenaded by the "Ordinary People" singer! "I will be singing for her, 'All Of Me,' which I wrote for her," Legend, 34, previously told <strong>Us</strong> at his private performance at The Box in NYC on Aug. 27. "I wrote most of the album about her."</p><p>The song is featured on his latest album Love In The Future, which was released over a week ago, on Sept. 3. A source tells <strong>Us</strong> that the couple made the decision to say "I do" before Legend left to tour in October.</p><p><a href=#>As for pre-wedding jitters</a>, the pair revealed that getting cold feet was never an issue. "I guess you're supposed to get nervous before you get married but I feel good," Legend said at NYC club The Box on Aug. 27. Teigen similarly admitted that any worry she may have had before her trip down the aisle was over something silly. "My jitters come from the dumbest things, like, 'Oh my God, there are a few steps I have to go down," she told <strong>Us</strong> at the REAL-volutionary Awards Fashion Week Kickoff Party in NYC on Sept. 4. "I'm having these little nightmares [that] I'm going to fall."</p><p>She continued: "But no! We've been together for like a long time now so there's no, 'Is this the right decision?' No. There's none of that."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Indeed, <a href=#>the Sports Illustrated supermodel</a> had some fun before saying "I do" when she was joined by friends for a bachelorette party in Mexico in late August. "[There] were 10 girls in total," a source told <strong>Us</strong>. "They stayed at the Viceroy [Riviera Maya luxury resort] and had a blast!"</p><p>Legend and Teigen began dating in 2007. The "Tonight" singer's rep later told <strong>Us</strong> in late December 2011 that the R&B singer popped the question while the couple vacationed over the holidays in the Maldives.</p><p>"She's beautiful, smart, funny, a smitten Legend told <strong>Us</strong> about his new bride back on Sept. 5 at the Galore magazine party in NYC. "She loves to cook. She loves to eat. She's awesome."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGooJ5iuaazxKebZpuYp7a0v9hmq56hl5q7brnAq6myZZmjeqrAwKWwZmpgZoBygJg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rory-mcilroy-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Rory McIlroy Net Worth: How Rich Is The Golf Superstar?</span></a>
