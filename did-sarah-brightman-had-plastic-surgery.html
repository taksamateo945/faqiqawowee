Is she an authentically American beauty?</p><h2 id=has-sarah-brightman-had-plastic-surgery>Did Sarah Brightman Had Plastic Surgery?</h2><p>Sarah Brightman has previously stated that she had had plastic surgery. The singer had undergone liposuction in her early twenties.</p><p>As mentioned in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Mail</a>, Brightman had gotten rid of a “baby-fat pad” under her chin.</p><p>Now let’s take a glance at her older pictures and newer ones. If we analyze the photographs we can clearly see changes in Brightman’s eyes as well.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Celebrity Sarah Brightman Plastic Surgery Before After destin plastic surgery destin fl – <a href=#>http://t.co/nTHS0z7GpG</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6Mz1OZiy35</a></p>— Danita Porter (@DanitaJPorter) <a href=#>January 7, 2015</a><p>The other difference we can see is in her eyebrows, which are expected to have been modified using an eyebrow lifting procedure. Also, there are times the singer has been spotted struggling to smile as her plump cheeks stretched and eyebrows lifted above her tight face.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, the singer has always looked younger than her current age. She is already in her sixties but still has a suspiciously wrinkle-free face.</p><p>Furthermore, her body has always appeared slimmer, despite the fact that the singer has previously&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>declared</a>&nbsp;that she does not go to the gym.</p><h2 id=sarah-brightmans-illness-and-puffy-face-explained-is-she-sick>Sarah Brightman’s Illness, Health Condition&nbsp; and Puffy Face Explained: Is She Sick?</h2><p>Soprano singer Sarah Brightman is doing well. She looks energetic and very satisfied at the moment. Her puffy pillow face tells it everything.</p><p>However, there are times that even her “Pillow Face” has raised speculation about her illness.</p><p>Some of her fans have thought that her face has become puffed by getting over-injected with dermal fillers in their face. Thus leading to an overstuffed look which is unnatural for a woman of her age.&nbsp;While fillers are a great way to combat aging, they could also lead to rashes, swelling, itching, and bruising as additional side effects.</p><p>Similarly,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>disorders</a>&nbsp;such as Cushing’s syndrome, which occurs due to enlargement or inflammation of facial tissues, could also cause a puffy face.</p><p>Brightman, on the other hand, does not appear to be suffering from any illness that has resulted in her puffy face.</p><h2 id=sarah-brightmans-net-worth-in-2022-after-plastic-surgery-speculations>Sarah Brightman’s Net Worth In 2022 After Plastic Surgery Speculations</h2><p>The current net worth of Sarah Brightman is $60 million USD, as per the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p>The singer has earned all her fortunes as a classical crossover soprano singer and actress. Her album Phantom has sold 40 million copies worldwide, making it her most profitable record.</p><p>It is well known that ordinary people cannot afford cosmetic surgery or other aesthetic procedures. As a result, celebrities who earn more immediately become the subject of such rumors.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Westlake Dermatology</a>, the average national cost of Liposuction is $6,175 and body lift is around $15,350.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnaCdZaOWv6K0jJupop%2BYqbqiuoyhmJ1loKGutMDInGSsraKcsrPFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-reveals-prince-george-doesn-t-know-his-age-thinks-he-s-3-years-old-64351.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton Reveals Prince George Doesnt Know His Age Thinks Hes 3-Years-Old!</span></a>
