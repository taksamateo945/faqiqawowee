During the special, star <a href=#>Ryan Edwards</a> – who has been in and out of jail and rehab over the past couple of years – claimed that it was his ex Maci Bookout’s fault that he has such a bad relationship with their 10-year-old son, Bentley.</p><p>Both Bookout and Edwards appeared on part one of the reunion special along with their respective spouses, Taylor McKinney and <a href=#>Mackenzie Standifer</a>, and Maci and Taylor said that things have been good since they got a restraining order against Edwards.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>‘Teen Mom OG’ Star Ryan Edwards Is ‘Stepping Up’ Ahead Of The Birth Of His New Baby <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/5mfHzJXi23</a></p><p>— MTV Teen Mom (@TeenMomGossip) <a href=# rel=nofollow>September 3, 2019</a></p><p>“This past year of not talking to each other has been good,” said Bookout. “I’ve been able to work through my process of what I think about him.”</p><p>Taylor added that things with Edwards were “fine,” but host Dr. Drew noted that for Bentley to have a better relationship with his dad, the best course of action might be to drop the restraining order.</p><p>When it was Edwards and Standifer’s turn to talk, Standifer agreed with Dr. Drew, saying that it would be a good idea for Bookout to lift the restraining order so her husband could improve his relationship with his son. Edwards also claimed that it was all Bookout’s fault that things aren’t great between him and Bentley.</p><p>Edwards also talked about why he was in jail between January and April, and he claimed that he was doing well with his sobriety since he’s been home.</p><p>“I was tired of being on probation so I just completed my probation in jail,” said Edwards, “Mine started out with painkillers and addiction wasn’t even thought of.
