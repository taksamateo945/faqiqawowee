The comedian’s son is also present and decides to have a conversation about the episode.</p><p>“They need to work on that, right,” the father says to his son. The little one replies by saying. “Yes.” DJ Pryor then asks, “Did you understand it, though.” His son admittedly says, “No.”</p><p>Only this child!!

The little one uses hand gestures to convey his thoughts to dad. “That’s exactly what I was thinking,” the comedian father exclaims. “We think a lot alike,” Pryor concludes.</p><p>Shanieke found the interaction between her husband and son to be incredibly hilarious. “Only this child,” the mother said of her son. “Having a full-fledged conversation with Daddy, and Daddy is just as bad,” Shanieke mused.” #TheseTwoAreAMess.”</p><p>More than one million Facebook viewers shared the cute interaction, which led to massive notoriety for Kingston and his dad. “Y’all, watch this baby have a full d*mn convo with his daddy,” one Twitter fan shared along with the video. “I’ve probably watched this WAY too many times today,” another social media fan said.
