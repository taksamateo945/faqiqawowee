As fans know, Hannah B is going to be part of the dancing competition’s season 28 starting with September 16 when it’s set to premiere.

News, the man was asked if he was planning on watching Dancing with the Stars for Hannah.</p><p>‘To be honest, I’ve never watched that show so I’m probably still not going to watch that show,’ he responded.</p><p>Wyatt then added: ‘But I support Hannah and I know she’ll do good. She’s like a super fast learner and she dominates things very quickly, like, she picks up on stuff like this [snaps his finger], so I’m sure she’ll do good.’</p><p>Furthermore, he discussed the fact that Hannah and Tyler Cameron are nominated for The Competition Contestant at the E! People’s Choice Awards this year, saying that: ‘I’m going to vote Dylan Barbour. I’m going to take the middle lane there.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B2AiTuFHgit/</p><p>However Barbour is not one of the nominees so it was just his way of saying that he simply won’t vote for either one of his Bachelorette co-stars.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>But when he was asked if he thinks Hannah deserves to win the award, Wyatt admitted: ‘I don’t think there’s many people more motivated to be their absolute best than her.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeamrFuw9iaq61lo6q9sbvRrapmoJGju6K0jJtkqKZdma6vr8innmavmam1bsDHnmSsrJGnwG6u1K1krJmpqHqpsYywpqesXanCr7GMoqVma2FufXZ8jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danneel-ackles.html><span>←</span><span>Danneel Ackles- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Marriage</span></a>
