Comedian <strong>Eric Andre</strong> is known for his over-the-top, fake interviews on Adult Swim’s The Eric Andre Show. In a new interview with <a href=#>HuffPost Live</a>, the Don’t Trust the B— in Apartment 23 alum, 31, revealed that he had a particularly disgusting surprise for an unsuspecting <strong><a href=#>Lauren Conrad </a></strong>on the upcoming season of the comedy show.&nbsp;</p><p>“I puked during her interview, and then I ate my puke back up and she left,” the fake talk show host said laughing. “I tried to be like ‘Hey it’s all in jest, and I’m just playing a wacky guy,’ but she had her sunglasses on, and she was ready to leave the building as soon as possible.”&nbsp;</p><p>In previous seasons of the show, Andre has given his guests a warning about his crazy antics, but this season he tried a different approach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“This year I tried to tell them absolutely nothing,” he said. “I’m always prepping people, but I was like ‘What if I don’t even say a single word to them before or after?’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Other victims of Andre’s brand of humor included True Blood’s <strong><a href=#>Ryan Kwanten</a></strong> and pop star <strong><a href=#>Demi Lovato</a></strong>. But judging from the description of Conrad’s interview, the fashion designer and former reality star got the brunt of his insanity.&nbsp;</p><p>“She’s a little bit upset at me,” Andre said of the former Hills star, 28. “I’m sure she’s not a big fan of me and my brand of humor. I’m not trying to be a dick. I’m just joking. It’s all in fun.”</p><p><strong>Have a question you’d like to ask a celebrity?
