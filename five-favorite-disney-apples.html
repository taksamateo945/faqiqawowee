At Disney? Of course! You may not realize it, but the delicious fruit does pop up here and there in Disney films and history. Here are some of our favorites:</p><p><strong>1) Snow White and the Poisoned Apple<br></strong>The most famous Disney apple is the one that started it all…the poisoned apple that the evil queen gives Snow White. As we all know, that one bite put Snow White in a near-death sleep, only to be awakened by true love’s kiss. Curiously, while the sequence of the apple was fairly straightforward in the Disney animated classic, things were a bit more complicated in the Brothers Grimm tale (published in 1812). In the original story, the queen first tries to offer Snow White a laced bodice (i.e., the top part of Snow White’s outfit) as a present, then a poisoned comb. Neither of them work however, and this is when the queen offers up the poisoned apple. In the Brothers Grimm version, the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white half (which is safe) and giving the red (poisoned) half to Snow White. A bit more complicated, but it just goes to show how devious the queen could be! The apple appeared in one of the more frightening scenes in the now-closed attraction, Snow White’s Scary Adventures. But I would still be wary if someone offered you an apple over by Princess Fairytale Hall!</p><p><strong>2) Tangled Up<br></strong>When New Fantasyland opened, it brought with it a host of new castles; the Beast’s castle atop Be Our Guest, and Prince Eric’s castle in Journey of the Little Mermaid. But there’s another sort of castle on the fringes of Fantasyland – Rapunzel’s Tower. Though the tower isn’t home to a restaurant or attraction, the new rest area is brimming with hidden details…from the wanted posters on the walls and horseshoe prints in the cement to the “Hidden Pascals” and the charming lanterns glowing in the night sky. But our favorite detail is one that is easily overlooked; a half-eaten apple sitting atop in unassuming barrel. Who would leave a half-eaten piece of fruit out in the open like that? We’ll give you a hint; the culprit is also responsible for those hoofprints that suspiciously lead away from the barrel!</p><p><strong>3) A Whole New World of…Apples?</strong><br>When you think of movies and apples, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs naturally comes to mind. But there’s another movie that incorporates the common fruit throughout its story, and it’s a movie that you might not suspect: Aladdin. Apples can be found throughout the film. For example, Jasmine inadvertently steals an apple to give to a hungry child while she wanders through the marketplace in disguise, and after Aladdin saves the day, he and Abu toss a few apples around as Aladdin laments that “there must be more to life than this.” Finally, when Jafar is holding Jasmine captive, he takes a devilish bite from an apple (what is it with villains and apples?) before Aladdin once again comes to the rescue.</p><p><strong>4) Caramel Apples</strong><br>Lest we forget, there are REAL apples to be found throughout Walt Disney World, making for a perfect snack any time of day. You can find them in market places such as those in Liberty Square and Sunset Boulevard (and let’s not forget the apple slices you can get at Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party!). But our favorite (though not necessarily the healthiest) are the caramel apples you can get at the Main Street Confectionery. Not only can you choose from a wide variety of themed caramel apples (especially around the holidays), but you can even watch them being made right before your eyes! Yum! We’ll take two please (and a Rice Krispie treat, just to change things up a little.)</p><p><strong>5) Be Our Guest</strong><br>This one’s not really an apple per se, at least not an actual piece of fruit, but this might be the most magical apple of them all. Mickey’s PhilharMagic is filled with wondrous special effects, from the droplets of water that splash on you as we go under the sea with Ariel, to the dazzling 3D effects…particularly Donald’s carpet ride through Agrabah. (Hmm, Aladdin and apples again?) But one of our favorite moments from the show is when Donald is trying to find Mickey’s Sorcerer Hat amongst the dishes and platters in the Be Our Guest segment. The highlight of the sequence is surely when Donald “slides” out into the audience, burnt pie in hand. Ah, the sweet smell of cinnamon apple pie!! Now which way is it to the Confectionery…</p><p>Those are our Five Favorite Disney Apples, do you have any that you like?
