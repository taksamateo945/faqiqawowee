The reason me and Janet broke it off is because she couldn’t be with a man like myself. I’m from the projects. I’m ‘hood. Her father wouldn’t allow her to be with someone like me. Janet was the crush of my life.”</p><p>After their breakup, Brown met <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Whitney Houston</a></strong>, whom he often publicly called the love of his life. Throughout their separate battles with drug addiction, the two were married for 15 years and gave birth to one daughter, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bobby Kristina</a></strong>. Sadly, Houston was found dead in a bathtub in a Los Angeles hotel at 48 in 2012. Her death was attributed to accidental drowning, however, the county coroner’s report listed other <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">contributing factors</a> such as heart disease and alleged cocaine use.</p><p>Bobby Kristina found it hard to cope with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">loss of her mother</a> and began to make headlines for her drug use and family disputes. Like her mother, the 22-year-old was found unresponsive in a bathtub in 2015; she then spent nearly six months in an induced coma.&nbsp;</p><p>Brown tragically lost his 28-year-old son, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bobby Brown, Jr</a>. in Nov. 2020. The L.A. County coroner&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ruled</a>&nbsp;his caused of death was the combined effects of cocaine, alcohol and the opioid fentanyl.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Music icon <a href=#>@KingBobbyBrown</a> and his family take fans behind the curtain in Bobby Brown: Every Little Step, an all-new docuseries premiering May 31st at 10/9c on A&E. <a href=#>#EveryLittleStep</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ERPpUmxcKz</a></p>— A&E (@AETV) <a href=#>April 20, 2022</a></figure><p>Throughout his losses, Brown found comfort and support in his now-wife<strong> Alicia Etheridge Brown</strong>, who was a close friend for years.
