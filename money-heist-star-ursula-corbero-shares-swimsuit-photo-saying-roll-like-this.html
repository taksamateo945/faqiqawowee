Corberó, who plays Tokyo on the show, shared gorgeous pictures of her getaway, including ones of her posing in a stunning lime green one-piece swimsuit. "Roll like this forever," she captioned the post. Corberó has a very relaxed approach to health, wellness, and diet—here's what it looks like.</span></p><p><span>Corberó doesn't have a strict workout routine, but loves dancing to stay in shape. "I burn a lot of energy, so my body asks me to&nbsp;</span><span>eat constantly," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I eat everything but good and rich. I like quality raw materials, but I don't follow any particular diet."</span></p><p><span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Corberó's perfect day off is either action packed or incredibly lazy and relaxed. "For me there are two perfect Sunday plans: one would be the active plan, getting up early, preparing an incredible fresh orange juice, toast with avocado, then going to the trail, enjoying the sun, going to the movies," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "And then there is the Sunday plan of doing nothing at all; I stay at home and that's it."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_2358409713.jpg><p><span>Corberó is honest about her worries related to aging in the entertainment industry, especially for actresses. "I would be lying to you if I said no; It is a fear that I believe, among actresses, is transmitted from generation to generation," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "There are many actresses who suffer from crisis when they start to age. There is nothing I like more than a [real] face, but if I'm honest, I don't know if I'll like it on me."</span></p><p><span>Corberó is not interested in restrictive diets, but enjoys many Spanish delicacies and snacks. "I really like to eat, eat delicious food," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I have a weakness for Asturian cachopos with their melted cheese, but a good cachopo—don't give me a defrosted one because I have a very fine palate. Recently a magazine suggested that I had gotten pregnant because I had a tummy in a photo and I answered yes, from a hamburger and some fries."</span></p><p><span>Corberó is learning to accept the rough with the smooth when it comes to her social media, and responds to comments on her own terms.&nbsp; "There are days when I respond to harsh comments, and I have come to the conclusion that if I feel like responding, I am going to do it because I feel comfortable with it," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I must say that there are comments from haters that I find very funny; there are very brilliant people and I suppose you have to take it with humor."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK67zZ6wZqCVnsC1edKtmKtlpafAtrjAZpqoqpKav7B50qGYq52jYsC4tcysrKKsXaW1sMDOZqqasZmjtG6%2BzqWjZqSZoLJuwMeiqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./donald-trump-calls-meghan-mccain-angry-and-obnoxious-201569.html><span>←</span><span>Donald Trump Calls Meghan McCain &amp;quot;Angry and Obnoxious&amp;quot;</span></a>
