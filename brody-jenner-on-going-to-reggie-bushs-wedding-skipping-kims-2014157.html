<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Brody Jenner on Skipping Kim's Wedding, Going to Reggie Bush's</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>No bad blood here! <strong><a href=#>Brody Jenner</a></strong> raised eyebrows this weekend when he attended the L.A. nuptials of stepsister <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong>'s ex-boyfriend <strong><a href=#>Reggie Bush</a></strong> on July 12, just two months after he was a no-show at her own European wedding to <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>. He insists, however, that his presence on Bush's special day was in no way a slight against his famous family—just one friend supporting another.</p><p>"It was awesome," Jenner, 30, told reporters at the 9th Annual ESPY Awards All-Star Celebrity Kickoff Party at the Mondrian in West Hollywood on Monday, July 14. "I love Reggie. It was a great wedding. It was beautiful."</p><p>Asked why he skipped his stepsister's "I dos" in Florence, Italy, back in May, he replied, "Kim's was in Paris. I was working. Kim's was in Paris—it's as simple as that." (Prior to the ceremony in Italy, the Kardashian-Jenner clan and other invited guests spent several days in Paris, France.)</p><p>"It's kinda ridiculous that everybody's making such a big deal out of it," Jenner continued. "Reggie's been a friend of mine for a very long time so I went to his wedding. It's all good."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Indeed, a source told <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> that "Brody and Reggie are really good friends. [Reggie] invited him months ago with a guest. In terms of Kim," the insider added, "one has nothing to do with the other."</p><p>Another source says, "Kim couldn't care less about Brody going to Reggie's wedding. Brody has been friends with Reggie since Kim introduced them many years ago."</p><p>Bush and Kardashian dated on-and-off for several years but split for good in March 2010. He and new wife <strong>Lilit Avagyan</strong> have one daughter, Briseis, 14 months, who was born a month before Kardashian and West's daughter North.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmrp5Suequxzaecq2Wfo3qou8innmasn2K%2FprPGopxmmqWotbR51p6bnaGenHq0t8ipp6Kml2K4qrnSZmlpaWRmgng%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./parker-pannell.html><span>←</span><span>Parker Pannell - CelebNetWorth</span></a>
