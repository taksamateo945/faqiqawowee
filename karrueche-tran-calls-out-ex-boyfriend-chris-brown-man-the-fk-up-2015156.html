The stylist and actress blasted her ex-boyfriend<strong> <a href=#>Chris Brown</a></strong> on Instagram on Sunday, June 14, after the rapper called her out for discussing their relationship with the media.</p><p>“First off @chrisbrownofficial you just did an interview w Ryan Seacrest in which you spoke about me. My interview w Access Hollywood was not entirely about you…they asked a question and as a mature adult I answered,” she began her Instagram post, referring to an interview she did with <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a> last week. “I’m not gonna shy away from something that I lived through. I'm talking about my life and experiences. I'm not speaking on you or bashing you (like I easily could). Don't be mad at me because our relationship is over due to your lack of loyalty. You know what's weak?? You forcing yourself into my car.. my broken window.. blowing up my phone.. trying to shower me w gifts.. Man the f—k up and change the bs in your life like I've told you several times. Since you want to hear about my career – check out @vanityseries every Thursday on StyleHaul.com.. Emmy winning @thebaytheseries this Sept and 3 Headed Shark Attack on SyFy next month. Best of luck to you and beautiful Royalty,” she concluded.</p><p>Tran’s post comes after Brown posted and then deleted an Instagram, in which he called her out for doing “pointless” interviews about their relationship.</p><p>Brown then chose to take a higher road, putting up another post, this time thanking Tran for their relationship. “I'm eternally thankful for you being in a part of my life. I've learned so much from you. I wish u nothing but happiness and the best. @karrueche all I was doing was trying to fight for the woman I love. Thanx I learned a lot,” he captioned a photo of them from happier times. &nbsp;</p><p>The on-again, off-again couple of four years split this past March after Tran learned that Brown had fathered a daughter while they were together.</p><p>Their feud on Instagram comes after the <a href=#>police were allegedly called</a> to Tran’s home on June 4, after she and Brown reportedly got into a heated altercation following a night out at Playhouse in Los Angeles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKaqqKqsqS0xGarq5meYrCiuMusZKitpGKyuXnBqLCfqpmau6V5wqGpoqtdl7%2Bww81mpJqmXam1pnnFpGSuqF1nfXKBkG5t</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-morgan-in-fear-the-walking-dead.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Morgan in Fear The Walking Dead?
