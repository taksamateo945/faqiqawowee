<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Shere Whitfield Shares Swimsuit Photo on Vacation</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Shereé Whitfield is heating up social media in her swimsuit. In a new social media post, the former Real Housewives of Atlanta star flaunts her incredibly fit figure at 53 in a neon yellow bathing suit. She shared the impressive snap via her Instagram Stories. How does the reality star and mother-of-three approach health and wellness? Celebwell rounded up her top lifestyle habits.</span></p><p><span>Shereé is hardcore about her workouts. "At least 3 days a week" she takes a kettlebell class. "That's my me time. A lot of people don't take that time but we all need it. That's my time for me, every morning, at the gym. It's not just about being healthy, it makes me feel good and jump starts my day," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Curly Nikki</span></a><span>. She regularly shares her workouts on social media. In one of her clips, she does a variety of exercises with a band, some stairs, and a bench, starting with tricep and shoulder moves with a band that she has placed around a handrail. Next, she walks up and down the stairs for cardio, followed by a set of jumping squats, leg raises, and deep lunges.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_2301505137.jpg><p><span>Shereé also loves to cycle. "I may spin 3 times a week," she told Curly Nikki. The </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Cleveland Clinic </span></a><span>explains that biking, a low-impact aerobic exercise, is great for building muscle, improving strength and flexibility, and improving balance. It can also boost mental health and help other health conditions, including arthritis.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_668875213.jpg><p><span>Shereé dished about her diet to Curly Nikki. "At breakfast I'll have egg whites, veggies in it, either chicken or turkey sausage and some fruit. At lunch, I'll have some fish, veggies or a salad. I'll have a frozen shake in between and I do like snacks… so I snack a bit between meals. And finally, at dinner, I'll have chicken and veggies," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/shutterstock_450944614.jpg><p><span>"I try to stay away from a lot of carbs like white breads and potatoes and things like that. I love sweets like maybe a cookie or a small piece of cake… that's how I get my carbs in, my bad carbs," Shereé added.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Shereé also enjoys a form of fighting fitness. "I may add in a kickboxing class," she told Curly Nikki. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard Health</span></a><span> maintains that boxing is a great way to build strength, improve balance, posture, hand-eye coordination, boost mood and endurance, and helps increase alertness.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/sheree.png><p><span>Finally, Shereé gets her steps in. "I try to walk the park at least 2 or 3 times a week," she told Curly Nikki. Going for a daily walk can be a game changer in terms of exercise, especially at a brisk speed. One study published in </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>JAMA Internal Medicine</span></a><span> found that walking at a brisk pace for about 30 minutes a day led to a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, dementia and death, compared with walking a similar number of steps but at a slower pace.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifLS0xKucnmWnnba1ssieo51lo52us7HSZqqwoZ2owqrAjKmfqKyfYryvedWampqsmaS7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dr-greg-neaville-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Dr Greg Neaville Obituary, Resident Of United States, Arkansas Has Passed Away</span></a>
